# Play & Watch

# Summary

This app is an e-commerce website that sells both video games and movies. Play & Watch is a full stack application which has all the basic functions of an e-commerce website such as placing orders, keeping track of orders through purchase history, product basket e.t.c. This web app is also capable of showing users suggested products based on the genre of their previous purchases.

Play & Watch was the final project of the GA Immersive course and it was also a group project. Our main objective was to use React to build the front-end and our timeframe for completion was one week. I was looking forward to using React so I found this project particularly interesting.

Web Site Heroku. GitHub Repo.

# Brief

* Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own frontend

* Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database

* Consume your API with a separate frontend built with React

* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models

* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut

* Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.

* Have automated tests for at least one RESTful resource on the backend, and at least one classical and one functional component on the frontend.

# Future Content

* Along with fixing the known bugs, there are a number of potential future features I could implement, such as:

* Adding an extra product for music.
* Allowing user to sort index page.
* Ability to remove specific genres from suggestions.
* Show top 5 suggestions on the index page within the image slider.
* Rewriting the suggestions based on relevance score - products of higher relevance will be shown first.
* Customer support chat.
* Stock management.
* And much more!
